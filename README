This is a Rocket League mafia discord bot that allows discord users to join a game and then add roles and quantities to their liking.
After that it randomly distributes the roles among the players and messages them their role.
It also has voting functionality so a user can vote and then will be messaged if they were correct or not.

/////////////
// RUNNING //
/////////////

Before you run it, you must add the bot to the server you want to use it in using this link:
https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=784673252307107841&permissions=0&scope=bot

After that, you need to add a .env file to the repository that contains text saying DISCORD_TOKEN= and then the bots discord token.
You can get this token from AcePocket#0426 on discord (it isn't something to be shared on the web)

To run the project, simply run the bot.py file ex. python bot.py
This bot is not being run on a server so in order for it to work, you need run it locally for the duration of your use.
